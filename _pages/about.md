I am a Professor in the Department of Computer and Information Science and
Engineering (CISE) at the University of Florida, where I currently serve as 
the Interim Department Chair. I am committed to the real-world impact of my
research, and have co-founded three start-up companies (Skim Reaper, 
CryptoDrop and Pindrop Security). My team and I have also uncovered critical
vulnerabilities in cellular and mobile networks, developed some of the 
strongest detectors of deepfakes and protections for voice-driven systems, 
and protected a wide range of other networked systems. Learn more about our 
work [on my publications page](/publications/).

I received a CAREER Award from the National Science Foundation in 2010, and 
was named a Sloan Fellow in 2014, a Fellow for the Center for Financial 
Inclusion at Accion in 2016, and a Kavli Fellow in 2017.
